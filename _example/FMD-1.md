title: Dynamic Analysis of Internal Android Systems
description: In this project, we focus on the current state of Android security. One main focus will be to determine current difficulties and limitations that hinder security researchers in performing a dynamic analysis of Android pre-installed software components such as pre-installed apps or native libraries. In a first step, we conduct a systematic literature review. Based on the findings of the stuy, we will derive potential solution ideas and will develop a concept and early prototypes (leveraging existing work where possible) for a security testing framework that will allow security researchers to dynamically test pre-installed Android software. The purpose of developing early proof-of-concept prototypes is to test the feasibility of our fundamental solution ideas.
