title: Dynamic Security Analysis of Android Pre-installed Apps
description: The project aims at enhancing security testing methodologies for Android pre-installed applications. It encompasses empirically evaluation of hindering factors associated with dynamic analysis of pre-installed apps on the Android emulator. To be more precise, the feasibility of rehosting Android pre-installed apps, extracted from real-world firmware, to different CPU architectures (x86/64, and ARM64) on the Android emulator is examined. Another goal of the project is to develop novel testing methodologies for pre-installed apps to improve compatibility, fault detection, and code coverage while contributing to the advancement of Android application testing practices.
