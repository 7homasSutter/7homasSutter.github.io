One main focus will be to determine current difficulties and limitations that hinder security researchers in performing a dynamic analysis of Android pre-installed software components such as pre-installed apps or native libraries. In a first step, we conduct a systematic literature review. Based on the findings of the stuy, we will derive potential solution ideas and will develop a concept and early prototypes (leveraging existing work where possible) for a security testing framework that will allow security researchers to dynamically test pre-installed Android software. The purpose of developing early proof-of-concept prototypes is to test the feasibility of our fundamental solution ideas.",

It encompasses empirically evaluation of hindering factors associated with dynamic analysis of pre-installed apps on the Android emulator. To be more precise, the feasibility of rehosting Android pre-installed apps, extracted from real-world firmware, to different CPU architectures (x86/64, and ARM64) on the Android emulator is examined. Another goal of the project is to develop novel testing methodologies for pre-installed apps to improve compatibility, fault detection, and code coverage while contributing to the advancement of Android application testing practices.",
